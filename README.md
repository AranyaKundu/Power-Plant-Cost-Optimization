### Power-Plant-Cost-Optimization <br>
This is made using Excel and VBA. The project can be better understood if you have some idea about the major cost and revenue components in installation, operation and maintenance of a typical Solar power plant. <br>
This requires some financial and technical understanding also. Understanding of terms like `accelerated depreciation`, `CapEx`, `Working Capital`, `CUF (Capacity Utilization Factor)`, `VGF (Viability Gap Funding)`, etc. might be required at some stages.
<br>The model has been built considering an Indian solar power plant. So, some figures are relevant in Indian context. However the concepts are almost same/ similar for any ground mounted Solar power plant across the globe.<br>
You can check the instructions in the instructions sheet to understand how the workbook can be utilized to gain tariff insights. <br>
Some worksheets are protected. Try to make copies and update/ mess around there. <br>
Also make the changes only after understanding the whole project. Otherwise output can go haywire.
Feel free to comment on any improvements.
